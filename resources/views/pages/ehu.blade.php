                    I am a computer science student at University of Windsor with 
                    corporate web development experience in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, ANGULARJS, Jquery and Bootstrap.

                    My coop experience started with Bulkbarn where I was a Helpdesk specialist where I
                     worked with 250 stores and 200 corporate employees to resolve issues. Then I was a service desk agent at HOOP where I
                      learned how to install windows operating system using images (KACE server). I was then as Quality Assurance Business Analyst 
                      at Blueprint Software Systems where I was responsible for creating executing testcases per user stories in TFS. I learned how 
                      to function in a agile environment, I also participated in multiple regression and release testing. Then I was a software 
                      developer at The Nielsen Company where I worked on a project called Receipt Capture where I was responsible for creating batch 
                      scripts to call SQL procedures that create databanks and organize raw data for clients. I was then a front end developer at
                       International Financial Data Services where I was part of team responsible for designing, development, and maintenance of
                        web-based solutions. This is where I worked with AngularJS and learned the Model-View-Controller concept. My most recent
                         coop term was as a Web Application Developer 
                    at DRC Video Production where I mastered creating dynamic web pages using PHP and creating user interface using pure JS.
